# metImages
Short project to clean data in the MET Api
I ran into issues using the MET Api since not all objects from 1 - 860,000 exist and only some of them have the primaryImage attribute due to copyright reasons. 
I wanted to get a list of the JSON objects that had primaryImages I could use in my web application so this was designed to output a .txt file with a list of all Object ID's
of appropriate Objects.
